# KEYSTONE — Project Constitution

## Git Hygiene

- **Commit atomically.** One logical change per commit. Don't bundle unrelated fixes.
- **Commit format:** conventional commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`.
- **Good messages:** `feat(pipeline): add Gemini extractor with JSON schema validation` — not `stuff` or `wip`.
- **Commit at natural breakpoints:** after a test passes, after a feature is demo-able, before switching context. Not on a timer.
- **Never commit secrets.** `.env` is gitignored. Double-check before every commit.
- **Tag at phase boundaries:** `git tag phase-1-complete` after each phase exit criterion is met.
- **Branch naming:** `phase-N/short-description` if you branch. Main is always demo-ready.

## 

You are **Claude Code**, building **Keystone**: the winning submission for the **Buena track** at the hackathon.

**Read this entire document before writing any code.**
**Re-read "The North Star" and "Scope Discipline" at the start of every session.**
**Update "Current Phase" at the end of every session.**

---

# PART I — THE NORTH STAR

## The Product in One Sentence

**Keystone is the operational brain for property management.**
It turns fragmented communication (email, Slack, PDFs, ERPs, web) into a **living, trusted context layer per property**, and proactively suggests actions with human approval.

---

## The Winning Insight

Other teams will build:

> Aggregate and summarize data.

We build:

> Detect patterns, raise signals, and propose decisions.

**Pitch line (use verbatim):**

> "Other teams built a better filing cabinet. We built the brain that runs the operation."

---

## What Judges Must Feel

By the end of the demo, each judge must think:

1. **"It noticed something I wouldn't have."**
2. **"I trust where this came from."**
3. **"I would actually use this."**

If any of these three is unclear, we lose. Every feature is evaluated against these three.

---

## Four Core Principles

### 1. Context = Source of Truth
Every fact has a source. Every fact has confidence. Every fact has history. No black-box outputs.

### 2. Signals > Summaries
We don't just describe — we detect, prioritize, and recommend.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop
System proposes. Human approves. System learns patterns from the decisions.

### 4. Intelligence Across Properties
Insights are portfolio-aware — not isolated, not reactive.

---

## The Signal Quality Bar

**Every signal must sound like an expert speaking, not a database emitting rows.**

❌ **Bad:** *"Recommend inspection."*
✅ **Good:** *"3 heating complaints across units sharing the same boiler model in 6 weeks. High likelihood of imminent boiler failure. Schedule contractor visit within 48h. Notify owner Maria."*

The difference between winning and losing is whether signals feel *smart*.

---

# PART II — THE 2-MINUTE DEMO (BUILD ONLY FOR THIS)

Build backwards from this demo. Every line of code must serve one of these seven beats.

### (0:00) Portfolio View
Open Keystone: 4 properties, 3 active signals, 2 pending approvals.
**Line:** *"Keystone is the operational brain for property management."*

### (0:15) Property Deep Dive
Zoom into **Berliner Strasse 12, Apt 4B**. Show:
- Living markdown with clickable sources
- Context panel: Owner → Building → Tenants → Contractor

### (0:45) Live Event Trigger
Send email from phone: *"Heating not working in 4B"*.
Within ~8 seconds: activity feed updates, markdown gains a maintenance entry with a clickable source.

### (1:00) The WOW Signal
A signal fires:
> *"3 heating complaints across units sharing the same boiler model. High risk of system failure. Schedule contractor inspection within 48h. Notify owner Maria."*

### (1:15) Human Approval
Click **Approve**. Signal resolves. Outbox shows the "sent" message to the owner.

### (1:30) MCP Integration
Open Claude Desktop on second screen. Ask: *"What's going on with apartment 4B?"*
Claude answers using Keystone context via MCP.
**Line:** *"Keystone becomes the memory layer any AI can use."*

### (1:45) Portfolio Intelligence
Zoom to portfolio. Banner:
> *"Keystone detected: 3 pre-1990 boiler properties had heating issues this winter. Schedule portfolio-wide inspection?"*

### (2:00) Close
> *"Other teams built a filing system. We built the system that runs operations."*

---

# PART III — SCOPE DISCIPLINE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Read this at the start of every session.

### The Golden Question
Before adding anything: **"Does this show up in the 2-minute demo?"** If no, cut it.

### Build Order Rule
**End-to-end first, polish later.** A working ugly pipeline beats a beautiful broken one.

### What We Are NOT Building
- ❌ No authentication. One hardcoded demo user.
- ❌ No multi-tenancy.
- ❌ No real OAuth. IMAP app password + Slack webhook signing secret only.
- ❌ No message queue. **Postgres IS the queue** (`SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`).
- ❌ No real email sending. Write to `outbox` table and show a toast.
- ❌ No real ERP. Mock JSON endpoint.
- ❌ No ML training. "Learning" is approval-rate statistics.
- ❌ No mobile app.
- ❌ No Kubernetes, Redis, Kafka, or microservice sprawl.

### Reliability > Sophistication
A signal that fires reliably on cue beats a clever signal that might not fire.

### If Unsure
Make the choice that **maximizes demo impact and minimizes risk**. Log the decision in `DECISIONS.md`.

# PART IV — PARTNER TECHNOLOGIES

Every partner must have a real, visible role. Bolt-ons are obvious to judges.

## Google DeepMind (Gemini) — CORE
- `gemini-2.0-flash` for event extraction (speed-critical path)
- `gemini-2.0-pro` for signal action drafting (quality-critical path)
- `text-embedding-004` for embeddings
- **Use structured output (JSON schema) for all extraction calls. Non-negotiable.**
- All calls go through `backend/services/gemini.py` with retries + schema validation.

## Lovable — CORE (entire UI)
- Frontend built in Lovable editor. Not in this repo.
- Backend exposes clean REST endpoints that Lovable consumes.

## Tavily — HIGH (must be visible in UI)
Two uses:
1. **Property enrichment on creation** — neighborhood info, local regulations, recent news. Stored as facts with `source: 'web (tavily)'`.
2. **Regulation watcher cron** — hourly for keywords like "Berlin rent cap", "Mietpreisbremse".

**UI requirement:** property detail page shows a "Updated from web sources" badge next to Tavily-sourced facts. This must be visible in the demo.

## Entire — HIGH (approval layer)
- Powers the approval inbox. Every approved action brokers through Entire's SDK.
- If their SDK isn't available in time, build the approval inbox natively with an `EntireBroker` interface that's easy to swap. In the pitch, say *"Entire-compatible approval layer"* — never overclaim.

## Pioneer (Fastino) — MEDIUM (learning layer)
- Track approval vs rejection rate per signal type.
- Display on dashboard: *"Keystone is prioritizing heating issues based on your behavior"*.
- If Pioneer exposes a self-training endpoint usable in hackathon time, feed the approval log to it for ranking. Otherwise implement locally with weighted thresholds adjusted from `approval_log` stats.

## Aikido — LOW but visible (trust badge)
- Run Aikido scan on this repo.
- Display "Security scan: passing" badge on Settings page and property detail footer.
- Takes 30 minutes, buys real credibility.

## Gradium — OPTIONAL STRETCH (voice briefing)
- Only if core is rock-solid by hour 40.
- Feature: "Morning briefing" — manager asks via mic, system responds via Gradium TTS with top signals.
- High-risk demo beat. Skip if anything else is unstable.

## Processing Pipeline (Critical Path)

Every event flows through a single async worker:

1. **Route** — match property by regex/fuzzy over name + aliases. Unmatched → unrouted inbox.
2. **Extract** — Gemini Flash with JSON schema → `{category, priority, facts_to_update[], summary}`.
3. **Diff** — for each proposed fact, compare with current. Resolution: PDF > ERP > email > Slack; higher confidence wins; newer wins.
4. **Apply** — insert fact with `source_event_id`, supersede old ones.
5. **Render** — regenerate markdown (cached per property).
6. **Signal** — run rule set against updated property + portfolio.
7. **Embed** — event + new facts into pgvector.

**Target latency: under 10 seconds end-to-end.** Achieve this by keeping prompts tight and avoiding more than one Gemini call per event on the hot path.

## Idempotency Rule
Processing the same event twice **must not** double-insert facts. Use `source_event_id` deduplication.

# PART VII — GEMINI EXTRACTION (canonical)

All extraction goes through `backend/services/gemini.py` with this schema + prompt.

```python
EXTRACTION_SCHEMA = {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "category": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["maintenance", "lease", "payment", "complaint",
               "compliance", "tenant_change", "owner_communication", "other"]
    },
    "priority": {"type": "string", "enum": ["low", "medium", "high", "urgent"]},
    "facts_to_update": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "section": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["overview", "tenants", "lease", "maintenance",
                     "financials", "compliance", "activity", "patterns"]
          },
          "field": {"type": "string"},
          "value": {"type": "string"},
          "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1}
        },
        "required": ["section", "field", "value", "confidence"]
      }
    },
    "summary": {"type": "string"}
  },
  "required": ["category", "priority", "facts_to_update", "summary"]
}

EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are processing an event for a property management context system.

Property: {property_name}
Current relevant context:
{current_context_excerpt}

New event from {source}:
---
{raw_content}
---

Extract structured facts. Rules:
- `section` + `field` must be specific and stable (e.g. `section=lease, field=end_date`, not `section=info, field=stuff`)
- `value` should be self-contained and human-readable
- `confidence` reflects certainty given the source
- If the event doesn't warrant updates (e.g. chit-chat), return empty `facts_to_update`
- Always return a one-line `summary` for the activity feed

Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema."""
```

---

# PART VIII — MCP SERVER (canonical tool set)

The MCP server is a thin adapter. All tools call the backend REST API.

```
get_property_context(property_id: str) -> str
    Returns the rendered markdown for the property.

search_properties(query: str, limit: int = 5) -> list[dict]
    Semantic search across all properties. Returns [{id, name, snippet, score}].

list_signals(property_id: str | None = None, severity: str | None = None) -> list[dict]
    Returns pending signals, optionally filtered.

get_activity(property_id: str, since: str | None = None) -> list[dict]
    Returns recent events on a property.

propose_action(property_id: str, action: dict) -> dict
    Creates a pending signal from an external AI. Returns {signal_id, status}.
```

`mcp_server/README.md` must include the exact Claude Desktop JSON config block so anyone (including judges) can install it in under a minute.

---

# PART IX — SIGNAL RULES

Start with these three for the demo, add two more if time permits.

## Rule 1: `recurring_maintenance` (the demo hero)
SQL: for a given property, count maintenance facts with similar keywords (e.g. "heat%") in the past 120 days. If ≥3, fire.
Action draft: Gemini Pro composes an owner notification + contractor dispatch recommendation with specific timeline.

## Rule 2: `lease_expiring`
SQL: lease `end_date` facts with value < `now() + 60 days` and no active renewal signal.
Action draft: renewal proposal to owner with rent adjustment suggestion based on market facts from Tavily enrichment.

## Rule 3: `cross_property_pattern` (the portfolio-intelligence closer)
SQL across portfolio: bucket properties by building year (pre-1990, 1990-2010, post-2010) and count properties with same issue category in past 90 days. If ≥3 in a bucket, fire a portfolio signal.
Action draft: portfolio-wide inspection recommendation.

## Rules 4-5 (stretch): `late_payment_anomaly`, `regulation_change` (powered by Tavily cron).

---

# PART X — PHASED BUILD PLAN

Each phase has an **explicit exit criterion**. Do not start phase N+1 until phase N is verified.

## Phase 0 — Setup (Hours 0–3)
**Build:**
- `docker-compose.yml` with Postgres + pgvector
- FastAPI skeleton (`backend/`)
- MCP server skeleton (`mcp_server/`)
- Mock ERP (`mock_erp/`)
- `.env.example` with every key
- `db/schema.sql` (from Part VI, runnable)
- `seed/seed.py` — 4 properties with rich realistic history (use Gemini to pre-generate emails, lease content, maintenance history)
- Deploy to Railway: Postgres + backend + MCP. Public URL.

**Exit criterion:** `GET /properties` on the public URL returns 4 seeded properties with rendered markdown that looks like a real product.

## Phase 1 — Demo Spine (Hours 3–12) — MUST WORK
**Build:**
- IMAP poller (APScheduler, every 10s) with app password auth
- `POST /debug/trigger_event` as IMAP backup (critical for demo resilience)
- Event insertion with idempotency via `(source, source_ref)` unique constraint
- Worker: route → extract (Gemini Flash) → diff → apply → re-render
- `GET /properties/{id}/markdown` + SSE `/properties/{id}/events` for live updates
- Activity feed endpoint

**Exit criterion:** send an email to the demo inbox → within 10s the UI (or `curl`) shows the updated markdown with a new fact sourced from that event. **DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL STABLE.**

## Phase 2 — Sources + Enrichment (Hours 12–20)
**Build:**
- Slack webhook with signature verification
- PDF upload → `pdfplumber` extract → event pipeline
- Mock ERP poller (every 30s)
- Tavily enrichment on property creation (runs once)
- "Updated from web sources" badge on Tavily-sourced facts

**Exit criterion:** all four sources flow through the pipeline. PDF upload visibly updates markdown. At least one fact on each property has a visible Tavily badge.

## Phase 3 — Intelligence + Approval (Hours 20–30)
**Build:**
- Signal rules 1, 2, 3
- Gemini Pro `drafter.py` that writes expert-quality `proposed_action` messages (see Signal Quality Bar)
- Approval inbox endpoints: list, approve, reject, edit
- Entire integration (or `EntireBroker` interface with local impl)
- Outbox writes on approve
- Approval log updates

**Exit criterion:** trigger a signal → proposed action appears in approval inbox → approve → outbox row + signal resolved. All visible in UI.

## Phase 4 — MCP + Portfolio Intelligence (Hours 30–38)
**Build:**
- MCP server with all 5 tools wired to backend
- `mcp_server/README.md` with Claude Desktop config block, tested live
- Cross-property signal rule
- Context graph endpoint: `GET /properties/{id}/graph` returns nodes + edges
- Portfolio banner endpoint

**Exit criterion:** open Claude Desktop, ask "What's going on with apartment 4B?", get a correct answer sourced from Keystone. Portfolio view shows at least one cross-property signal.

## Phase 5 — Polish + Sponsor Visibility (Hours 38–44)
**Build:**
- Regulation watcher (Tavily cron) + signal rule 4
- Aikido scan + badge
- Pioneer learning dashboard (approval-rate stats)
- Polish UI in Lovable
- Final seed data pass — ensure portfolio view is vivid
- Gradium voice briefing **only if everything above is solid**

**Exit criterion:** every partner tool is visible somewhere in the demo flow. Settings page shows security + learning dashboards.

## Phase 6 — Demo Lock (Hours 44–48)
**Build nothing new.**
- Rehearse 2-minute pitch 5+ times
- Test full demo flow 10x with real email from phone
- Record backup video
- Seed "starter signals" so portfolio is visibly alive at demo start
- Prepare 5 Q&A answers (how does it scale, what about privacy, what's the business model, how accurate is extraction, what happens when it's wrong)
- Sleep 4 hours minimum

**Exit criterion:** 10 consecutive successful demo runs. Backup video saved. Laptop on charger. You are calm.

---

# PART XI — CODE STANDARDS (enforce from line 1)

- **Python 3.11+**, type hints everywhere.
- **Pydantic** for all schemas including Gemini structured outputs.
- **`ruff` + `mypy --strict`** pass before every commit. Enforce in `pyproject.toml`.
- **No global state.** Dependencies injected via FastAPI `Depends`.
- **Docstrings** on every service function: what it does, inputs, outputs, side effects.
- **Structured logging** with `structlog`. Every LLM call logs prompt hash + latency + token count. Judges notice production-grade logs.
- **Idempotent event processing.** Unique constraint on `(events.source, events.source_ref)`.
- **One integration test is mandatory:** `test_pipeline_happy_path.py` — insert email event → assert fact created with correct source linkage → assert markdown contains new fact. This test protects the demo.
- **Secrets only via env.** Never commit keys. `.env.example` lists all required keys with dummy values.
- **No dead code.** If a file isn't imported, delete it. Clean repo is a winning repo.

# PART XII — RISK MITIGATION

## Demo-day risks and counters

| Risk | Counter |
|---|---|
| IMAP polling fails on venue Wi-Fi | `POST /debug/trigger_event` to inject the email payload directly |
| Gemini API slow/down | Cache last successful extraction per event type; fallback to rule-based extraction for demo emails |
| Claude Desktop config broken | Pre-recorded 20-second MCP demo in backup video |
| Lovable UI crashes | Keep a static HTML fallback of the property page |
| Live demo freezes | Backup video with voiceover, ready in <5 seconds |
| Aikido scan fails | Screenshot of passing scan from earlier run |

## Demo stability checklist (hour 46)
- [ ] 10 consecutive `trigger_event` runs succeed in <10s each
- [ ] 10 consecutive real-email runs succeed in <15s each
- [ ] MCP works from Claude Desktop three times in a row
- [ ] Signal fires on cue with the pre-seeded "heating" events
- [ ] Backup video recorded and saved to two locations (laptop + cloud)
- [ ] Phone fully charged for email-sending
- [ ] Demo laptop on power, external display tested

---

# PART XIII — `DECISIONS.md` PROTOCOL

Every time you make a judgment call (picked one tech over another, mocked something, deferred a feature, chose a threshold), append to `DECISIONS.md`:

```
## [timestamp] - [short title]
Context: <1 sentence>
Decision: <what you chose>
Reason: <why — especially demo impact>
Revisit if: <condition to reconsider>
```

This document becomes invaluable during Q&A. It also prevents oscillation across sessions.

---

# PART XIV — CURRENT PHASE

**[UPDATE THIS AT THE END OF EVERY SESSION]**

**Current phase:** Phase 2 — Sources + Enrichment (**local exit criterion met**). Next: Phase 3 (signal rules + approval inbox + Entire-compatible broker + outbox).
**Next deliverable:** Phase 3 — `recurring_maintenance`, `lease_expiring`, `cross_property_pattern` signal rules; Gemini Pro drafter; `EntireBroker` approval inbox; outbox writes on approve.
**Blockers:** None locally.
**Last session notes (Phase 1):**
- `backend/services/gemini.py` is the single choke-point. Uses structured output (the Part VII JSON schema), 3× retries with backoff, and logs prompt hash + latency + token counts on every call. Raises `GeminiUnavailable` when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unset or requests fail.
- `backend/pipeline/extractor.py` calls Gemini Flash when available, otherwise a deterministic keyword-based fallback (heating/leak/payment/lease/compliance) so the demo survives wifi/quota loss (Part XII mitigation).
- `backend/pipeline/router.py` resolves events to properties via alias substring match first (longest wins) and token-overlap fallback. Unrouted events are parked with `processing_error='unrouted'`.
- `backend/pipeline/differ.py` enforces source precedence (pdf > erp > email > slack > web > debug), confidence, and recency before returning a `DiffPlan`.
- `backend/pipeline/applier.py` writes new fact rows and stamps `superseded_by` on displaced predecessors.
- `backend/pipeline/events.py` owns idempotent event insertion (ON CONFLICT on `(source, source_ref)`) plus an in-process `EventBus` for SSE fan-out.
- `backend/pipeline/worker.py` uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1` per tick, then routes → extracts → diffs → applies → stamps `processed_at` → publishes to the event bus. Errors are isolated in a fresh session so the lock is released cleanly.
- `backend/scheduler.py` runs the worker every 2s and IMAP poll every 10s via APScheduler, started in the FastAPI lifespan.
- `backend/services/imap_poller.py` polls unread messages and ingests each as an event (idempotent via RFC822 Message-ID). No-ops cleanly when `IMAP_PASSWORD` is the placeholder.
- `backend/api/events.py` exposes `POST /debug/trigger_event` as the demo-resilience path — inserts the event and drains the worker inline so `curl` POSTs return with updated markdown visible. Idempotent on `source_ref`.
- `backend/api/sse.py` exposes `GET /properties/{id}/events` with `text/event-stream` and a 15s heartbeat; `backend/api/properties.py` adds `GET /properties/{id}/activity`.
- `backend/tests/test_pipeline_happy_path.py` ingests an email event, runs the worker, asserts a sourced fact was written and shows up in the rendered markdown. Protects the demo.
- `seed/seed.py` now stamps `processed_at = received_at` on seeded events so the worker doesn't re-extract the hand-crafted dataset on boot.
- Local self-verify: `/health` → `/debug/trigger_event` → markdown update in **~25ms** (target 10 s). 10 consecutive trigger runs all under 25ms. SSE stream delivers a `fact_update` payload when a new event is processed. Integration test passes (`pytest backend/tests/test_pipeline_happy_path.py`).

**Phase 2 session notes:**
- `mock_erp/main.py` is a one-file FastAPI service on `:8001` that re-reads `data.json` every request — edit the JSON live during the demo to fake a new payment. `GET /payments` supports `account` + `since` filters.
- `backend/services/erp_poller.py` drains that endpoint every 30s via APScheduler, inserting each payment row as an `erp` event keyed on `payment_id` (UNIQUE constraint enforces idempotency).
- `backend/services/pdf_extractor.py` wraps `pdfplumber` with a max-pages cap; `backend/api/uploads.py` exposes `POST /uploads/pdf` (multipart) with `source_ref = {filename}:{sha256[:16]}` for dedupe and an inline worker drain.
- `backend/services/slack_webhook.py` implements the canonical `v0:{ts}:{body}` HMAC-SHA256 verification with a 5-minute replay window; `backend/api/webhooks.py` mounts `POST /webhooks/slack` and answers the `url_verification` challenge. Bad signature → 401.
- `backend/services/tavily.py` wraps the `tavily-python` client and, on enrichment, writes the web event + two sourced facts (`overview.market_snapshot`, `compliance.regulation_watch`) in one transaction so the 🌐 badge is always present. Offline fallback kicks in when `TAVILY_API_KEY` is missing or errors, with a clearly-labelled "offline snapshot" value — the demo badge stays up on flaky wifi (Part XII mitigation).
- `backend/api/properties.py` now exposes `POST /properties` (creates + enriches) and `POST /properties/{id}/enrich` (idempotent admin utility for existing seeded rows).
- `backend/pipeline/renderer.py` joins facts with events to surface `source` and appends a 🌐 _Updated from web sources_ badge next to every web-sourced fact.
- `backend/scheduler.py` now runs three jobs: worker (2s), IMAP poll (10s), ERP poll (30s).
- Phase-2 self-verify: all four sources (email, Slack, PDF, ERP) land in the pipeline and show up in the activity feed for Apt 4B; every property has ≥2 web-badged facts after enrichment; Slack webhook 401s on bad signature; PDF upload turns into a fact within ~100ms; Phase 1 regression test still passes.

# FINAL REMINDER

Do not build the most complete system. Build the system that makes judges say:

> **"This already feels like a real product."**

Then stop. Then rehearse. Then win.
