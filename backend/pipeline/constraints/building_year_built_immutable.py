"""Building year-built is immutable, full stop.

A building only has one year built; this is a Bauamt fact, not a
free-text fact. We reject *any* attempt to change it after the
stammdaten load — even structural permits don't change the year
built. Corrections are an admin action via the override endpoint
with a written audit reason.
