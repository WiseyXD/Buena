"""Phase 11 — semantic event validator.

The rule-based validator (:mod:`backend.pipeline.validator`) catches
known immutable-field contradictions (floor count, address, year
built, …) using hand-coded constraints. The semantic validator
complements it: it asks Pioneer/Claude to read the **canonical
property file** and the **new event** side-by-side and surface every
claim that contradicts what we already know — not just the dozen
fields someone hardcoded.

Why both layers exist:

- Rule-based constraints are **deterministic**: same input, same
  verdict, no Pioneer cost. They guard the high-stakes immutable
  fields with explicit reasons and required-source-type metadata.
- The semantic validator is **general**: it covers fields nobody
  thought to write a constraint for ("event mentions a 7th floor in a
  4-floor building", "event names a different tenant than stammdaten",
  "event claims rent of €5000 when the lease says €1100"). It costs
  one Pioneer call per event, runs after extraction, and emits the
  same :class:`Rejection` shape so the existing rejected_updates
  inbox surfaces both kinds uniformly.

The validator never hallucinates new facts. Pure contradictions of
existing context are the only thing it surfaces.

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You audit one new event against the existing canonical
record for a property. Your output decides whether each claim in the
event is consistent with what's already on file.

PROPERTY FILE (canonical, condensed record — Stammdaten at top, then
sectioned facts with confidence and source links):
\"\"\"
{property_file}
\"\"\"

NEW EVENT (source: {source}):
\"\"\"
{event_body}
\"\"\"

PROPOSED FACTS the extractor pulled from the event (already filtered
through the rule-based validator; these would be applied unless you
flag a contradiction):
{proposed_block}

DEFINITIONS

- A "contradiction" is a claim in the event that DIRECTLY conflicts
  with a fact in the PROPERTY FILE. Examples:
  • event mentions "7. Stockwerk" / "7th floor" but the building has
    4 floors per stammdaten
  • event names tenant "Hans Müller" but the active tenant on file is
    "Anna Schmidt"
  • event claims rent €5000 when stammdaten says kaltmiete €1100
  • event refers to address "Hauptstraße 12" when the property file
    shows "Immanuelkirchstraße 26"
- "Novel" information (new maintenance issue, new bank payment, new
  email request) is NOT a contradiction. Do not flag novel claims.
- "Stammdaten" entries (master record at top of the file) are
  authoritative — only an authoritative document can revise them.
  Free-text events that contradict stammdaten are HARD rejections.
- A current fact with confidence ≥ 0.9 is also strong; contradictions
  there are HARD rejections. Lower-confidence facts are SOFT — flag
  them as needs_review.

SEVERITY

- "hard": stammdaten contradiction OR contradicts a high-confidence
  fact, AND the event source is free-text (email / slack / letter).
- "soft": contradicts a lower-confidence fact, or the event has
  document_type that *could* legitimately revise the record (e.g.
  structural_permit for floor count). These need a human review.

Always be conservative. If a claim is ambiguous, don't flag it —
returning "all_consistent" is the default.
