"""Step 8 — signal discovery on Buena real data.

Run after Step 6's email backfill lands so the SQL has data to chew
on. Produces a markdown report (printed to stdout, redirect to
``eval/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-signal-discovery.md``) covering:

1. Top properties by event volume (90 d).
2. Overlapping maintenance categories per property.
3. Email response-time distribution per thread_id.
4. Bank late- / missing-payment patterns per property.
5. Contractor concentration per building.
6. Owner communication volume per property.
7. Unrouted ``verwendungszweck`` strings frequency table.
8. Threads with no resolution after 14+ days.

Each section emits a heading, a top-N table, and a one-line takeaway
on what kind of signal rule the data suggests. Step 8's quality bar
(``precision ≥ 80% on the eval set``) means each candidate must be
validated end-to-end before promotion to ``signal_rule_definitions``;
the discovery script just surfaces the candidates.

Usage::

    python -m eval.notebooks.signal_discovery
    python -m eval.notebooks.signal_discovery --out eval/runs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-signal-discovery.md

The script is intentionally read-only — no fact writes, no event
mutations. Safe to run while the backfill / live worker are active.
